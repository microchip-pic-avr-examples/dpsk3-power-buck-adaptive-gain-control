### Features Added\Updated
Although the two new features of the buck converter device driver are not used in this code example, they extend the feature set when the buck converter device driver is migrated to user projects.
The application layer configuration also covers the configuration of the new features and teh hardware description header file was extended to contain user settings and macros for easy code migration.

The application documentation got updated by fixing some typos and adding documentation of the boost converter interface description.
